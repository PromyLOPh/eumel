The *Extendable multi user microprocessor ELAN system (EUMEL)* is a microkernel
operating system. *Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung (GMD)* and
*Hochschulrechenzentrum (HRZ)* of Bielefeld University created and developed it
between 1978 and 1990. L3, EUMEL’s successor, is still in use by a few legacy
systems as of 2016.
